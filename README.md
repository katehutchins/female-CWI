Data and code for paper "Treating Exertional Heat Stroke: Limited Understanding of the Female Response to Cold Water Immersion"

Authors: Kate P Hutchins, Geoffrey M Minett, Ian B Stewart

The mini review examined the literature on women's response to cold water immersion as a treatment for exertional heat stroke and aimed to clarify whether the current guidelines have appropriately considered research investigating women. 

The code and data provided are a secondary analysis of published data by Lemire et al. (2009)* comparing the responses of hyperthermic men and women to whole-body cold-water immersion.
